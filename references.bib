	abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN/sup 3/) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

This book provides the necessary mathematical foundation of multicriteria optimization to solve nonlinear, linear and combinatorial problems with multiple criteria. Motivational examples illustrate the use of multicriteria optimization in practice. Numerous illustrations and exercises as well as an extensive bibliography are provided.

	abstract = {A large spectrum of quality indicators has been proposed so far to assess the performance of discrete Pareto set approximations in multiobjective optimization. Such indicators assign, to any solution set, a real-value reflecting a given aspect of approximation quality. This is an important issue in multiobjective optimization, not only to compare the performance and assets of different approximate algorithms, but also to improve their internal selection mechanisms. In this paper, we adopt a statistical analysis to experimentally investigate by how much a selection of state-of-the-art quality indicators agree with each other for a wide range of Pareto set approximations from well-known two- and three-objective continuous benchmark functions. More particularly, we measure the correlation between the ranking of low-, medium-, and high-quality limited-size approximation sets with respect to inverted generational distance, additive epsilon, multiplicative epsilon, R2, R3, as well as hypervolume indicator values. Since no pair of indicators obtains the same ranking of approximation sets, we confirm that they emphasize different facets of approximation quality. More importantly, our statistical analysis allows the degree of compliance between these indicators to be quantified.},

They are grossly classified as economic, quality and environmental indicators and their simultaneous consideration can be used to define the overall performance of a manufacturing process. Optimizing the overall performance of food processing requires the use of multi-objective optimization methods. Multi-objective optimization methods include five steps: defining the objectives, modelling performance indicators, formulating the problem and constraints, solving the multi-objective problem, and finally identifying an ideal solution. The integration of data-driven approach, particularly machine learning, into the multi-objective optimization offers new perspectives for optimizing and controlling food processes. The potential of this approach is still underestimated by the food industry sector.},

For Emmental-type cheese, dry matter content has to be above but as close as possible to a minimal value that is defined by legislation. The means for achieving the target dry matter content was mostly left to the discretion of the cheese experts, who target a dry matter objective based on his expert knowledge and the deviation of cheese production. To date, the prediction of performance indicators, such as cheese dry matter content, can help cheesemakers to improve their production performance. Several Machine Learning models and classical statistical methods were compared to predict the dry matter of Emmental cheese for a set of data coming from one selected cheese industry. The Random Forest method emerged as the most effective model (RMSE = 0.28 and R2 = 0.67). The weight of variables in explaining the variability of cheese dry matter content was also calculated, helping cheese experts to interpret the model and apply corrective actions to improve cheese production performance. The ability to predict cheese dry matter content and understand its variability from cheese manufacturing data offer new perspectives for the cheese industry. This method can be transferred to other indicators and assist in decision-making to enhance industry performance.},

This is accompanied in each category by detailed descriptions of several representative indicators and in-depth analyses of their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, issues regarding attributes that indicators possess and properties that indicators are desirable to have are discussed, in the hope of motivating researchers to look into these important issues when designing quality indicators and of encouraging practitioners to bear these issues in mind when selecting/using quality indicators.

As part of the paper we describe the criterion from a theoretical perspective and examine its performance on a number of test problems.

	abstract = {The most commonly used stopping criterion in Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithms is an a priori fixed number of generations (or evaluations). But it is rather difficult to speak about achieving a particular compromise between the quality of the final solutions and the computation time when stopping an algorithm this way. Unfortunately, whereas single-objective Evolutionary Algorithms can stop when the fitness does not improve during a given number of generations, such "steady-fitness" stopping criterion does not easily extend to the multi-objective framework. This paper introduces a stability measure based on the density of the non-dominated solutions and proposes to use it to stop the optimization process when no significant improvement is likely to take place on further iterations. This approach is validated by the empirical results obtained applying NSGA-II to the well-known bi-objective ZDT-benchmarks. In particular, the problem ZDT4 best illustrates the ability of the proposed criterion to avoid useless continuation of a wedged optimization process when a local Pareto-optimal set is reached.},

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to use a correct tool for measuring the performance of the diverse set of metaheuristic algorithms to derive an appropriate judgment on the superiority of the algorithms and also to validate the claims raised by researchers for their specific objectives. The performance of a randomized metaheuristic algorithm can be divided into efficiency and effectiveness measures. The efficiency relates to the algorithm’s speed of finding accurate solutions, convergence, and computation. On the other hand, effectiveness relates to the algorithm’s capability of finding quality solutions. Both scopes are crucial for continuous and discrete problems either in single- or multi-objectives. Each problem type has different formulation and methods of measurement within the scope of efficiency and effectiveness performance. One of the most decisive verdicts for the effectiveness measure is the statistical analysis that depends on the data distribution and appropriate tool for correct judgments.},

	abstract = {Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms evolve a population of solutions through successive generations towards the Pareto-optimal Front. One of the most critical questions faced by the researchers and practitioners in this domain, relates to the number of generations that may be sufﬁcient for an algorithm to offer a good approximation of the Pareto-optimal Front, for a given problem. Ironically, till date this question largely remains unanswered and the number of generations are arbitrarily ﬁxed a priori, with potentially punitive implications. If the a priori ﬁxed generations are insufﬁcient, then the algorithm reports suboptimal solutions. In contrast, if the a priori ﬁxed generations are far–too-many, it implies waste of computational resources. This paper proposes a novel entropy based dissimilarity measure that helps identify on-the-ﬂy the number of generations beyond which an algorithm stabilizes, implying that either a good approximation has been obtained, or that it can not be obtained due to the stagnation of the algorithm in the search space. Given that, in either case no further improvement in the approximation can be obtained, despite additional computational expense, the proposed dissimilarity measure provides a termination criterion and facilitates a termination detection algorithm. The generality, on-the-ﬂy implementation, low computational complexity, and the demonstrated efﬁcacy of the proposed termination detection algorithm, on a wide range of multi- and many-objective test problems, deﬁne the novel contribution of this paper.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, evolutionary algorithms (EA) have proven their applicability to hard and complex industrial optimization problems in many cases. However, especially in cases with high computational demands for fitness evaluations (FE), the number of required FE is often seen as a drawback of these techniques. This is partly due to lacking robust and reliable methods to determine convergence, which would stop the algorithm before useless evaluations are carried out. To overcome this drawback, we define a method for online convergence detection (OCD) based on statistical tests, which invokes a number of performance indicators and which can be applied on a stand-alone basis (no predefined Pareto fronts, ideal and reference points). Our experiments show the general applicability of OCD by analyzing its performance for different algorithmic setups and on different classes of test functions. Furthermore, we show that the number of FE can be reduced considerably --- compared to common suggestions from literature --- without significantly deteriorating approximation accuracy.},

Its theoretical properties justify its wide acceptance, particularly the strict monotonicity with respect to set dominance which is still unique of hypervolume-based indicators. This paper discusses the computation of hypervolume-related problems, highlighting the relations between them, providing an overview of the paradigms and techniques used, a description of the main algorithms for each problem, and a rundown of the fastest algorithms regarding asymptotic complexity and runtime. By providing a complete overview of the computational problems associated to the hypervolume indicator, this paper serves as the starting point for the development of new algorithms, and supports users in the identification of the most appropriate implementations available for each problem.},

It seeks to give a representative picture of the termination conditions in EAs over the past decades, segment the contributions of termination conditions into progress indicators and termination criteria. With respect to progress indicators, we consider a variety of indicators, in particular in convergence indicators and diversity indicators. With respect to termination criteria, this paper reviews recent research on threshold strategy, statistical inference, i.e., Kalman filters, as well as Fuzzy methods, and other methods. Key developments on termination conditions over decades include: (i) methods of judging the algorithm's search behavior based on statistics, and (ii) methods of detecting the termination based on different distance formulations.},

	abstract = {After adequately demonstrating the ability to solve different two-objective optimization problems, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) must demonstrate their efficacy in handling problems having more than two objectives. In this study, we have suggested three different approaches for systematically designing test problems for this purpose. The simplicity of construction, scalability to any number of decision variables and objectives, knowledge of the shape and the location of the resulting Pareto-optimal front, and introduction of controlled difficulties in both converging to the true Pareto-optimal front and maintaining a widely distributed set of solutions are the main features of the suggested test problems. Because of the above features, they should be found useful in various research activities on MOEAs, such as testing the performance of a new MOEA, comparing different MOEAs, and better understanding of the working principles of MOEAs.},

	abstract = {When attempting to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of an algorithm, it is important to have a strong understanding of the problem at hand. This is true for the field of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as it is for any other field. Many of the multiobjective test problems employed in the EA literature have not been rigorously analyzed, which makes it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms tested on them. In this paper, we systematically review and analyze many problems from the EA literature, each belonging to the important class of real-valued, unconstrained, multiobjective test problems. To support this, we first introduce a set of test problem criteria, which are in turn supported by a set of definitions. Our analysis of test problems highlights a number of areas requiring attention. Not only are many test problems poorly constructed but also the important class of nonseparable problems, particularly nonseparable multimodal problems, is poorly represented. Motivated by these findings, we present a flexible toolkit for constructing well-designed test problems. We also present empirical results demonstrating how the toolkit can be used to test an optimizer in ways that existing test suites do not},
